# Exercise 2: Prompt Engineering practices

Having crafted deployment models, let's now embark on the journey of discovering how Contoso can seamlessly incorporate the artistry of Prompt Engineering techniques.

## Lab Scenario

In this exercise, you will step into Contoso Corporation's AI lab, where you'll unravel Prompt Engineering using the deployment models created in the previous exercise, crafting powerful AI prompts in hands-on experiments at the cutting edge of innovation.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
- Deploy a model
- Use Chat Playground to perform various tasks by using examples.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is a relatively [new discipline](https://www.businessinsider.com/prompt-engineering-ai-chatgpt-jobs-explained-2023-3) for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) across a wide variety of business applications. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) and refine the completions (outputs) of LLMs. Prompt engineering is used to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks, such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.
