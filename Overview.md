# Innovate with Azure OpenAI sandbox

## Overview

OpenAI's powerful language models like GPT-3 through API calls with Azure services like Cognitive Services and Machine Learning. Prioritize data management, security, and scalability. Stay informed about updates from both Azure and OpenAI to continually enhance your application. Check official documentation for the latest information and guidance.

### Key features of Azure OpenAI

- **Seamless Integration**: Integration of OpenAI's language models into Azure services for streamlined development.
- **Scalability**: Ability to scale applications using Azure's infrastructure combined with the capabilities of OpenAI models.
- **Cognitive Services Integration**: Integration with Azure Cognitive Services for additional AI-powered functionalities.
- **Developer-Friendly APIs**: User-friendly APIs that make it easy for developers to leverage OpenAI capabilities within the Azure environment.
- **Security and Compliance**: Robust security measures and compliance features to handle sensitive data in accordance with industry standards.
- **Cost-Effective Solutions**: Optimized pricing models for efficient utilization of both Azure and OpenAI services.

## Sandbox Scenario

Contoso Corporation revolutionized its engineering practices by synergizing Microsoft Azure and OpenAI. They tailored Azure OpenAI service hyperparameters, optimizing AI models for data analytics and task automation. The company programmatically harnessed Azure OpenAI's capabilities, utilizing Python to interact with APIs, and generating and refining code. This extended to generating images with a DALL-E model, showcasing versatility in both text and visual domains. Contoso delved into natural language processing (NLP) by integrating ChatGPT on SQL Engine through Azure OpenAI, enhancing data analysis and insights extraction. Leveraging their own data and exploring content filters, Contoso personalized AI applications. They adopted knowledge mining with Azure Cognitive Search, extracting valuable insights from extensive datasets. Building their own Copilot, including a semantic kernel and deploying a Chat Copilot application, reflected Contoso's commitment to advanced, integrated AI-driven development practices.

## About the Sandbox

Using this environment, You'll be able to explore complete features and offerings offered by Azure OpenAI. Please find the detailed overview of the sandbox environment below.

### Pre-provisioned resources

#### **Virtual Machines**: 

- 1 *Windows Server 2022 Datacenter* Virtual machines, virtual machine-related resources like Virtual networks, Network security groups, managed disks, Network interface cards, and IP addresses are deployed as part of the automation.

  You are recommended to use the same virtual machine throughout the lab for the best experience throughout the lab.

#### **License and subscription**: 

- You'll have access to a pre-configured Microsoft user account with an active Azure subscription, and a tenant assigned to the user. 
   
  The user account has been assigned as Owner at subscription. You need to use the same user account throughout the lab to get the most out of the lab. 

#### **Azure Credits**: 

- You have been given a quota of **$90 USD** which includes the running cost of Pre-deployed resources, license cost, and other resources deployed while running through the lab.

  You will receive **cost alerts** to your registered email address at **50%/75%/90%/95%/100%** of the allotted Azure Credit is spent.

  You can visit the Azure Subscription page to check the current Azure credit spend and Analysis on **Cost analysis** tab under the Cost Management option.

#### **Duration and Deletion of sandbox**:  

- The sandbox environment will be active for **14 days/336** hours from the time of registration. 
- The allowed uptime of the virtual machine is **40 hours**.
- The virtual machines will automatically **shut down** if not in use or if virtual machines are left idle. This feature is enabled in virtual machines to minimize the Azure spend.
- When 100% of Azure credits are spent, the sandbox environment will get automatically deleted without any prior notification. To retain the environment for a longer period and to get the most out of the environment, please follow the best practices mentioned below.

#### **Best practices**: 

- **Resources usage**: Please stop the virtual machines and other resources when not in use to minimize the Azure spend.

- **Azure Cost Analysis**: Maintain a practice of checking the Cost Analysis report of the assigned Azure subscription often in check the Azure spend so that the environment is for a longer duration of time.

- **Alert notifications**: Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails. Alerts give you can head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible.
