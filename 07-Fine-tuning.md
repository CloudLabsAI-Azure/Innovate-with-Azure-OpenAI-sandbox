# Exercise 7: Fine-tuning an Azure OpenAI Model

Azure's OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo stands out as a robust language model capable of producing text that closely resembles human language. The fine-tuning process is the method of enhancing the model's performance by training it on a particular task or domain. This involves the creation of a sample fine-tuning dataset, preparation of sample training and validation datasets, uploading them for the fine-tuning process, generating a fine-tuning job, and ultimately deploying a custom fine-tuned model.


### Task 1: Creating and Fine-Tuning OpenAI GPT Models on Azure

1. Naviagte back to [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), search and select **Azure OpenAI**, from the **Cognitive Services | Azure OpenAI pane**, select the **OpenAI-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. On **openai-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** blade, select **Keys and Endpoint (1)** under **Resource Management**. Select **Show Keys (2)** Copy **Key 1 (3)** and the **Endpoint (4)** by clicking on copy to clipboard and paste it into a text editor such as Notepad for later use. 

1. Run the below command in the **PowerShell**. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE` with `openAI Key 1` and `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE` with `openAI Endpoint`.

   ```
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY_VALUE_HERE', 'User')
   [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT', 'REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE', 'User')
   ```

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** from the Lab VM desktop by double-clicking on it.

   ![](media/vscode.png "Deploy model configurations")

1. In Visual Studio Code from menu bar select **File(1)>open folder(2)**.

1. Within **File Explorer**, navigate to `C:\LabFiles` select `Fine Tuning` (1) click on **Select folder(2)**.

   - Although these few instances serve as a helpful guide for understanding the basic structure if you aim to guide your custom fine-tuned model to respond similarly, a more extensive set of examples is necessary. Typically, a minimum of 50 high-quality examples is recommended as a starting point. However, certain use cases may demand thousands of meticulously chosen training examples for success.

   - In general, doubling the size of the dataset can result in a linear improvement in model quality. It's crucial to note that the inclusion of low-quality examples can have a detrimental impact on performance. If the model is trained on a substantial amount of internal data without prior curation for the highest quality examples, there's a risk of obtaining a model with significantly lower-than-expected performance

1. Create the files with the name `training_set.jsonl` add the following details and save the file.     

   ```
   {"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Clippy is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Who discovered Antarctica?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Some chaps named Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, as if they don't teach that in every school!"}]}

   ```

1. Create the files with the name `validation_set.jsonl` add the following details and save the file. 

   ```

   ```

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook named it as `Fine Tuning model.ipynb`. 

1. Copy and paste the following code in the first cell and **Execute the cell** (using either **Ctrl + Enter** to stay on the same cell or **Shift + Enter** to advance to the next cell) and observe the results.

   - Now need to run some preliminary checks on our training and validation files.

   ```
   import json

   # Load the training set
   with open('training_set.jsonl', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       training_dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

   # Training dataset stats
   print("Number of examples in training set:", len(training_dataset))
   print("First example in training set:")
   for message in training_dataset[0]["messages"]:
       print(message)

   # Load the validation set
   with open('validation_set.jsonl', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
       validation_dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

   # Validation dataset stats
   print("\nNumber of examples in validation set:", len(validation_dataset))
   print("First example in validation set:")
   for message in validation_dataset[0]["messages"]:
       print(message)
   ```

   - In this case, we only have 10 training and 10 validation examples so while this will demonstrate the basic mechanics of fine-tuning a model this is unlikely to be a large enough number of examples to produce a consistently noticeable impact.

1. Add a new cell by clicking on **+ Code**, Copy and paste the following code and **Execute the cell** (using either **Ctrl + Enter** to stay on the same cell or **Shift + Enter** to advance to the next cell) and observe the results.

   - Additional code from OpenAI using the tiktoken library to validate the token counts. Individual examples need to remain under the gpt-35-turbo-0613 model's input token limit of 4096 tokens.

   ```
   import json
   import tiktoken
   import numpy as np
   from collections import defaultdict

   encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base") # default encoding used by gpt-4, turbo, and text-embedding-ada-002 models

   def num_tokens_from_messages(messages, tokens_per_message=3, tokens_per_name=1):
       num_tokens = 0
       for message in messages:
           num_tokens += tokens_per_message
           for key, value in message.items():
               num_tokens += len(encoding.encode(value))
               if key == "name":
                   num_tokens += tokens_per_name
       num_tokens += 3
       return num_tokens

   def num_assistant_tokens_from_messages(messages):
       num_tokens = 0
       for message in messages:
           if message["role"] == "assistant":
               num_tokens += len(encoding.encode(message["content"]))
       return num_tokens

   def print_distribution(values, name):
       print(f"\n#### Distribution of {name}:")
       print(f"min / max: {min(values)}, {max(values)}")
       print(f"mean / median: {np.mean(values)}, {np.median(values)}")
       print(f"p5 / p95: {np.quantile(values, 0.1)}, {np.quantile(values, 0.9)}")

   files = ['training_set.jsonl', 'validation_set.jsonl']

   for file in files:
       print(f"Processing file: {file}")
       with open(file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
           dataset = [json.loads(line) for line in f]

       total_tokens = []
       assistant_tokens = []

       for ex in dataset:
           messages = ex.get("messages", {})
           total_tokens.append(num_tokens_from_messages(messages))
           assistant_tokens.append(num_assistant_tokens_from_messages(messages))
    
       print_distribution(total_tokens, "total tokens")
       print_distribution(assistant_tokens, "assistant tokens")
       print('*' * 50)
   ```

1. Upload fine-tuning files by adding a new cell by clicking on **+ Code**, Copy and paste the following code and **Execute the cell** (using either **Ctrl + Enter** to stay on the same cell or **Shift + Enter** to advance to the next cell) and observe the results.

   ```
   # Upload fine-tuning files
   import openai
   import os

   openai.api_key = os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY") 
   openai.api_base =  os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT")
   openai.api_type = 'azure'
   openai.api_version = '2023-12-01-preview' # This API version or later is required to access fine-tuning for turbo/babbage-002/davinci-002

   training_file_name = 'training_set.jsonl'
   validation_file_name = 'validation_set.jsonl'

   # Upload the training and validation dataset files to Azure OpenAI with the SDK.

   training_response = openai.File.create(
       file=open(training_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune", user_provided_filename="training_set.jsonl"
   )
   training_file_id = training_response["id"]

   validation_response = openai.File.create(
       file=open(validation_file_name, "rb"), purpose="fine-tune", user_provided_filename="validation_set.jsonl"
   )
   validation_file_id = validation_response["id"]

   print("Training file ID:", training_file_id)
   print("Validation file ID:", validation_file_id)
   ```

1.  Begin fine-tuning by adding a new cell by clicking on **+ Code**, Copy and paste the following code and **Execute the cell** (using either **Ctrl + Enter** to stay on the same cell or **Shift + Enter** to advance to the next cell) and observe the results.

    - Now that the fine-tuning files have been successfully uploaded you can submit your fine-tuning training job.

    ```
    response = openai.FineTuningJob.create(
        training_file=training_file_id,
        validation_file=validation_file_id,
        model="gpt-35-turbo-0613",
    )

    job_id = response["id"]

    # You can use the job ID to monitor the status of the fine-tuning job.
    # The fine-tuning job will take some time to start and complete.

    print("Job ID:", response["id"])
    print("Status:", response["status"])
    print(response)
    ```

1. Track training job status by adding a new cell by clicking on **+ Code**, Copy and paste the following code and **Execute the cell** (using either **Ctrl + Enter** to stay on the same cell or **Shift + Enter** to advance to the next cell) and observe the results.

   - If you would like to poll the training job status until it's complete.
  
   ```
    # Track training status

    from IPython.display import clear_output
    import time

    start_time = time.time()

    # Get the status of our fine-tuning job.
    response = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job_id)

    status = response["status"]

    # If the job isn't done yet, poll it every 10 seconds.
    while status not in ["succeeded", "failed"]:
        time.sleep(10)
    
        response = openai.FineTuningJob.retrieve(job_id)
        print(response)
        print("Elapsed time: {} minutes {} seconds".format(int((time.time() - start_time) // 60), int((time.time() - start_time) % 60)))
        status = response["status"]
        print(f'Status: {status}')
        clear_output(wait=True)

    print(f'Fine-tuning job {job_id} finished with status: {status}')

    # List all fine-tuning jobs for this resource.
    print('Checking other fine-tune jobs for this resource.')
    response = openai.FineTuningJob.list()
    print(f'Found {len(response["data"])} fine-tune jobs.')
    ```

   - **Note**: It can take more than an hour to complete training the custom Models, you can continue with the next Exercises. Once custom Models deployment get succeeded you can continue with Task 2

   ```
   import json
   import requests

   token= os.getenv("TEMP_AUTH_TOKEN") 
   subscription = "<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"  
   resource_group = "<YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>"
   resource_name = "<YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_NAME>"
   model_deployment_name ="YOUR_CUSTOM_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"

   deploy_params = {'api-version': "2023-05-01"} 
   deploy_headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(token), 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}

   deploy_data = {
       "sku": {"name": "standard", "capacity": 1},
